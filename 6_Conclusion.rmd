# Conclusion


The project developed a recommender system for a movies' set of ratings. After exploring the dataset and visually confirming a number of intuitions about movie ratings, we ran three models: a linear regression, a generalised linear model and a Lasso model (regularised linear model). All three performed poorly against the project target.

We then estimated ratings with a low-rank matrix factorisation estimated through a stochastic gradient descent. This proved very efficient and yielded a RMSE of 0.7996 against the validation dataset.

Two further work avenues are suggested:

+ Convergence speed could potentially be improved by noting that the cost function is $\lambda$-strongly convex, and the SGD algorithm can be improved. See section 14.5.3 of [@shalev2014understanding].

+ The three models proposed can also be formulated as minimisation of a cost function that can then be minimised using stochastic gradient descent, therefore being able to use the entire dataset.
